**Java-Based "Angry Birds" Inspired Game**
 
 Overview
This Java project is an homage to the classic "Angry Birds" game. It's crafted as a 2D game where players strategically launch birds to topple structures and defeat foes. Utilizing Java's Swing and AWT, this game blends simple physics with engaging gameplay mechanics.

 Key Features
Basic Physics Implementation: The game simulates gravity and motion to create a realistic bird-launching experience.
Player Interaction: Players use the mouse to set the trajectory and power of the bird's flight from a slingshot.
Collision Dynamics: Includes elementary collision detection for interactions between the birds, barriers, and adversaries.
Level Customization: Easily alter the game's difficulty and layout by modifying obstacle and enemy placements.

 Gameplay
Bird Launching: Click, drag, and release the mouse to determine the flight path and strength of the bird's launch.
Goal: The primary aim is to knock down all the barriers and eliminate all enemies using the provided birds.
Technical Composition
Java Swing & AWT: These libraries are employed for window creation, event handling, and rendering.
Game Loop Thread: A dedicated thread is used to keep the gameplay smooth and responsive.
Adjustable Game Elements: Parameters like bird size and enemy positioning can be tailored within the code.
 
 Installation and Execution
 Download or clone this repository to your local system.
Open the project in an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA.
Confirm that Java, along with Swing and AWT libraries, are correctly configured.
Execute the GameWindow class to launch the game.
 
 Prospects for Expansion
Implementing a more complex physics engine, like JBox2D, for enhanced realism.
Designing additional levels with progressive challenges.
Developing a scoring mechanism and keeping track of player scores.
Improving visual appeal with advanced graphics and animations.
